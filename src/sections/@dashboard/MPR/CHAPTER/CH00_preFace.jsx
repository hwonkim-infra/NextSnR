           <p >Recently, more advanced machinery, which is less dependent on human operators, has been introduced on the market. Such machinery is working on defined tasks and in structured environments, yet it can learn to perform new actions in this context and become more autonomous. Further refinements to machinery, already in place or to be expected, include real-time processing of information, problem solving, mobility, sensor systems, learning, adaptability, and capability of operating in unstructured environments (for example construction sites). The Commission Report on the safety and liability implications of Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things and Robotics of 19&nbsp;February&nbsp;2020, states that the emergence of new digital technologies, like artificial intelligence, the Internet of things and robotics, raises new challenges in terms of product safety. The report concludes that the current product safety legislation, including Directive&nbsp;2006/42/EC, contains a number of gaps in this respect that need to be addressed. Thus, this Regulation should cover the safety risks stemming from new digital technologies.</p>

However, repair and maintenance operations which do not affect the machinery or related product’s compliance with the relevant essential health and safety requirements should not be considered to be substantial modifications. In order to ensure the compliance of such a product with the relevant essential health and safety requirements, the person that carries out the substantial modification should be required to perform a new conformity assessment before placing the modified product on the market or putting it into service. In order to avoid an unnecessary and disproportionate burden, the person carrying out the substantial modification should not be required to repeat tests and produce new documentation in relation to machinery or related products that are part of an assembly of machinery, and that are not affected by the modification.</p>

           <p >The list of products in Annex IV of Directive 2006/42/EC has until now been based on the risk emanating from the intended use or any reasonably foreseeable misuse of those products or their critical protective function. Nevertheless, the machinery field embraces new ways of designing and constructing machinery or related products that might present higher risk factors, regardless of such intended use or any reasonably foreseeable misuse. For example, systems with self-evolving behaviour ensuring safety functions should be included in Annex I due to their characteristics such as data dependency, opacity, autonomy and connectivity, which might considerably increase the probability and severity of harm and seriously affect the safety of the machinery or related product. Therefore, the conformity assessment of a safety component or a system with self-evolving behaviour ensuring safety functions should be carried out by a third party, whether or not the safety component has been placed independently on the market or is part of a system embedded in machinery that is placed on the market. However, where machinery embeds a system of which the safety component has already been subject to third party conformity assessment when it was placed independently on the market, that machinery should not have to be re-certified by a third party solely on the basis of the embedding of that system.</p>
