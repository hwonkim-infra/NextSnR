      If the operator is intended to sit during operation and the operating position is an integral part of the
      machinery or related product, the seat shall be provided with the machinery or related product.

      The operatorâ€™s seat shall enable him or her to maintain a stable position. Furthermore, the seat and its distance
      from the control devices shall be capable of being adapted to the operator.

      If the machinery or related product is subject to vibrations, the seat shall be designed and constructed in such a
      way as to reduce the vibrations transmitted to the operator to the lowest level that is reasonably possible. The
      seat mountings shall withstand all stresses to which they can be subjected. Where there is no floor beneath the
