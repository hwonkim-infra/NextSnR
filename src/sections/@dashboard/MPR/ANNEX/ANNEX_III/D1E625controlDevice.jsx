      Where a control device is designed and constructed to perform several different actions, namely, where there is no
      one-to-one correspondence, the action to be performed shall be clearly displayed and subject to confirmation,
      where necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Control devices shall be so arranged that their layout, travel and resistance to operation are compatible with the
      action to be performed, taking account of ergonomic principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Machinery or related products shall be fitted with indicators as required for safe operation. The operator shall
      be able to read them from the control position.
    </p>
    <p>
      From each control position, the operator shall be able to ensure that no one is in the danger zones, or the
      control system shall be designed and constructed in such a way that starting is prevented while someone is in the
      danger zone.
    </p>
    <p>
      If neither of these possibilities is applicable, before the machinery or related product starts, an acoustic
      and/or visual warning signal shall be given. The exposed persons shall have time to leave the danger zone or
      prevent the machinery starting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      If necessary, means shall be provided to ensure that the machinery or related product can be controlled only from
      control positions located in one or more predetermined zones or locations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where there is more than one control position, the control system shall be designed in such a way that the use of
      one of them precludes the use of the others, except for stop controls and emergency stops.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the machinery or related product has two or more operating positions, each position shall be provided with
      all the required control devices without the operators hindering or putting each other into a hazardous situation.
