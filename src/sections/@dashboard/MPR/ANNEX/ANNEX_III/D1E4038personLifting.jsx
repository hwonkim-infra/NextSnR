    <p className="oj-normal">Machinery or related products presenting particular risks due to the lifting of persons shall meet all the relevant essential health and safety requirements set out in this chapter (see General Principles, point 4).</p>

            </p>
            <p className="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e4057-44-1">6.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span className="oj-italic">Mechanical strength</span>
            </p>
            <p className="oj-normal">The carrier, including any trapdoors, shall be designed and constructed in such a way as to offer the space and strength corresponding to the maximum number of persons permitted on the carrier and the maximum working load.</p>
            <p className="oj-normal">The working coefficients for components set out in sections 4.1.2.4 and 4.1.2.5 are inadequate for machinery or related products intended for the lifting of persons and shall, as a general rule, be doubled. Machinery or related products intended for lifting persons or persons and goods shall be fitted with a suspension or supporting system for the carrier designed and constructed in such a way as to ensure an adequate overall level of safety and to prevent the risk of the carrier falling.</p>
            <p className="oj-normal">If ropes or chains are used to suspend the carrier, as a general rule, at least two independent ropes or chains are required, each with its own anchorage.</p>
            <p className="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e4072-44-1">6.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span className="oj-italic">Loading control for machinery or related products moved by power other than human strength</span>
            </p>
            <p className="oj-normal">The requirements of section 4.2.2 apply regardless of the maximum working load and overturning moment, unless the manufacturer can demonstrate that there is no risk of overloading or overturning.</p>
            <p className="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e4083-44-1">6.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span className="oj-bold">Control devices</span>
            </p>
            <p className="oj-normal">Where safety requirements do not impose other solutions, the carrier shall, as a general rule, be designed and constructed in such a way that persons in the carrier have means of controlling upward and downward movements and, if appropriate, other movements of the carrier.</p>
            <p className="oj-normal">In operation, those control devices shall override any other devices controlling the same movement with the exception of emergency stop devices.</p>
            <p className="oj-normal">The control devices for the movements referred to in the first paragraph shall be of the hold-to-run type except where the carrier is completely enclosed. If there is no risk of persons or objects on the carrier colliding or falling and no other risks due to the upward and downward movements of the carrier, control devices authorising automatic stops at preselected positions may be used instead of hold-to-run type control devices.</p>

            </p>
            <p className="oj-normal">Machinery or related products for lifting persons shall be designed, constructed or equipped in such a way that the acceleration or deceleration of the carrier does not engender risks for persons.</p>

            </p>
            <p className="oj-normal">The carrier shall not tilt to an extent, which creates a risk of the occupants falling, including when the machinery or related product and carrier are moving.</p>
            <p className="oj-normal">Where the carrier is designed as a workstation, provision shall be made to ensure stability and to prevent hazardous movements.</p>
            <p className="oj-normal">If the measures referred to in section 1.5.15 are not adequate, carriers shall be fitted with a sufficient number of suitable anchorage points for the number of persons permitted on the carrier. The anchorage points shall be strong enough for the use of personal protective equipment against falls from a height.</p>
            <p className="oj-normal">Any trapdoor in floors or ceilings or side doors shall be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent inadvertent opening and shall open in a direction that obviates any risk of falling, should they open unexpectedly.</p>

            <p className="oj-normal">Where there is a risk of objects falling on the carrier and endangering persons, the carrier shall be equipped with a protective roof.</p>

            </p>
            <p className="oj-normal">The carrier shall be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent risks due to contact between persons and/or objects in or on the carrier with any fixed or moving elements. Where necessary in order to fulfil this requirement, the carrier itself shall be completely enclosed with doors fitted with an interlocking device that prevents hazardous movements of the carrier unless the doors are closed. The doors shall remain closed if the carrier stops between landings where there is a risk of falling from the carrier.</p>
            <p className="oj-normal">Machinery or related products shall be designed, constructed and, where necessary, equipped with devices in such a way as to prevent uncontrolled upward or downward movement of the carrier. These devices shall be able to stop the carrier at its maximum working load and at the foreseeable maximum speed.</p>
            <p className="oj-normal">The stopping action shall not cause deceleration harmful to the occupants, whatever the load conditions.</p>
