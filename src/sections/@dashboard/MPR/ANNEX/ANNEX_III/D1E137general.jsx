                Nevertheless, it is essential to examine the whole of this Annex in order to be sure of meeting all the
                relevant essential health and safety requirements. When machinery or a related product is being designed,
                the requirements of the first chapter and the requirements of one or more of the other chapters shall be
                taken into account, depending on the results of the risk assessment carried out in accordance with point 1
                of these General Principles. Essential health and safety requirements for the protection of the
                environment are applicable only to the machinery or related products referred to in section&nbsp;2.4.
